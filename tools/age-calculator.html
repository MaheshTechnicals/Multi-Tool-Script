                    <h3>How Age Calculation Works</h3>
                    <div class="method-explanation">
                        <h4>Standard Age Calculation Method</h4>
                        <p>Our age calculator uses the most widely accepted method for determining age, which calculates the difference between your birth date and the current date. The process involves several steps:</p>

                        <ol class="calculation-steps">
                            <li><strong>Year Difference:</strong> Calculate the difference in years between birth year and current year</li>
                            <li><strong>Month Adjustment:</strong> Adjust for months - if the current month is before your birth month, subtract one year</li>
                            <li><strong>Day Precision:</strong> Fine-tune based on the specific day - if the current day is before your birth day in the birth month, adjust accordingly</li>
                            <li><strong>Time Precision:</strong> When birth time is included, calculate down to hours and minutes for maximum accuracy</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Leap Year Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Leap years add complexity to age calculations, especially for those born on February 29th. Our calculator handles these edge cases by:</p>
                        <ul class="leap-year-handling">
                            <li>Recognizing leap years in both birth year and current year</li>
                            <li>Properly handling February 29th birthdays in non-leap years</li>
                            <li>Adjusting day counts for accurate month and day calculations</li>
                            <li>Ensuring consistency across different calendar systems</li>
                        </ul>
